# SlideStage — Offline, Browser-Based Presentation Studio

SlideStage is a fully in-browser presentation studio:

- Upload and view PDF slides
- Add a draggable, resizable webcam overlay
- Generate real-time subtitles (Vosk WASM — coming shortly; MVP includes mic path with placeholder)
- Record via your browser's built-in "Record This Tab"
- Save preferences locally via Local Storage
- Host anywhere (GitHub Pages-friendly)

## Quick Start

1. Open `index.html` in a modern browser (Chrome/Edge recommended).
2. Click "Open Studio".
3. Load a PDF, enable Webcam, enable Subtitles (placeholder in MVP), and use "Record This Tab".

## Features (MVP)

- PDF slide viewer (pdf.js via CDN)
- Webcam overlay (draggable + resizable)
- Subtitles (audio pipeline prepared; Vosk integration in next iteration)
- Local storage for settings (webcam position/size, notes, theme)
- Dark/Light mode toggle

## Recording (No Code Needed)

Use the browser's tab capture to record:

- Slide viewer
- Webcam overlay
- Subtitles overlay
- Cursor movements
- Microphone audio

### Steps (Chrome/Edge)

- Start your recording tool or extension and select "Record This Tab".
- Ensure microphone is enabled in the capture options.
- Stop the recording to save a `.webm` locally.

## Architecture

- Browser-only, no servers.
- pdf.js renders local PDF entirely client-side.
- getUserMedia provides webcam/mic.
- Local Storage persists settings.
- Vosk WASM will run speech-to-text offline in-browser.

## Roadmap

- Integrate Vosk WASM (small English model). UI to choose model.
- Export transcript to `.txt`.
- Laser pointer (red dot on click).
- Timer.
- Optional canvas-based recording (slides + webcam merged) without tab capture.

## Host on GitHub Pages

- Put the contents of this folder in a GitHub repo.
- Enable GitHub Pages: Settings → Pages → Source: `main` → `/root`.
- Your site will be live at `https://<user>.github.io/<repo>/`.

## Privacy

- Everything runs locally in your browser.
- No uploads, no accounts, no tracking.
